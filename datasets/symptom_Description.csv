Disease,Description
Drug Reaction,"An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. ADRs can range from mild to severe and can affect different organs or systems of the body. Some common types of ADRs are allergic reactions", side effects, interactions, overdose, and idiosyncratic reactions.
Malaria,"An infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites from the Plasmodium family that can be transmitted by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito or by a contaminated needle or transfusion. Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type. Malaria causes fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, and anemia. If not treated promptly, it can lead to severe complications such as cerebral malaria, kidney failure, respiratory distress, and death.
Allergy,An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance that's not typically harmful to your body. These foreign substances are called allergens. They can include certain foods", pollen, or pet dander. Your immune system's job is to keep you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens. However, sometimes it mistakes an allergen for a pathogen and produces antibodies to attack it. This causes an allergic reaction that can manifest as skin rashes, hives, itching, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, asthma," or anaphylaxis"
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone regulates the metabolism of the body and affects many functions such as growth, development, body temperature, heart rate, and brain activity. Hypothyroidism can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, hair loss, constipation, depression, and menstrual irregularities."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. They can pop up anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family. Psoriasis is caused by an abnormal immune system response that triggers inflammation and rapid growth of skin cells. Psoriasis can be triggered by stress, infections, medications, injuries, or environmental factors."
GERD,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux disease or heartburn disease , is a digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach. The LES normally closes tightly after food passes into the stomach to prevent stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. However, in GERD , the LES becomes weak or relaxes abnormally , allowing stomach acid to rise up into the esophagus and cause symptoms such as burning chest pain , regurgitation , nausea , difficulty swallowing , and chronic cough ."
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestatic diseases , whether occurring in infancy , childhood or adulthood , are characterized by defective bile acid transport from the liver to the intestine , which is caused by primary damage to the biliary epithelium in most cases . Bile acids are essential for digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins . When bile acid transport is impaired , bile acids accumulate in the liver and cause liver injury , inflammation , and fibrosis . Chronic cholestasis can also lead to malabsorption , malnutrition , pruritus , jaundice , and osteoporosis ."
hepatitis A,Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function. Hepatitis A is usually spread by contact with contaminated food or water , or through close contact with someone who has the infection . Hepatitis A can cause symptoms such as fever , fatigue , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , dark urine , clay-colored stools , and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Most people recover from hepatitis A within a few weeks without treatment , but some may develop complications such as liver failure or relapsing hepatitis .
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis , affecting millions of people worldwide . It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down over time . This causes the bones to rub against each other , leading to pain , stiffness , swelling , and reduced mobility of the affected joints . Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body , but it is most common in the hands , knees , hips , and spine . Osteoarthritis is more likely to occur with age , obesity , injury , overuse , or genetic factors ."
(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo — the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo causes brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness that are triggered by certain head movements or changes in position . BPPV occurs when tiny calcium crystals in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the semicircular canals , which are responsible for balance and orientation . BPPV can be treated with specific maneuvers that reposition the crystals in the inner ear .
Hypoglycemia, Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than normal. Glucose is your body's main energy source. Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes. Hypoglycemia can cause symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, hunger, headache, confusion, dizziness, weakness, and anxiety. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, or death. Hypoglycemia can be treated by consuming a fast-acting carbohydrate source such as glucose tablets, juice, or candy.
Acne,"Acne vulgaris is the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and/or cysts as a result of obstruction and inflammation of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous gland). Acne develops on the face and upper trunk. It most often affects adolescents. Acne is caused by a combination of factors such as hormonal changes, excess sebum production, bacterial infection, inflammation, and genetic predisposition. Acne can be treated with topical or oral medications that target one or more of these factors."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn't make enough — or any — insulin or doesn't use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and foot problems. Diabetes can be diagnosed with blood tests that measure your blood glucose level."
Impetigo,"Impetigo (im-puh-TIE-go) is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children. Impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, and on hands and feet. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts. Impetigo is caused by bacteria that enter through a break in the skin, such as a cut, scratch, insect bite, or eczema. Impetigo can spread from person to person by direct contact with the sores or items that have touched the sores. Impetigo can be treated with antibiotics that kill the bacteria."
Hypertension,"Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms. However, long-term high blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension can be classified as primary (essential) or secondary depending on the underlying cause. Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause and is usually influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. Secondary hypertension results from an identifiable cause such as kidney disease , endocrine disorders , medications , or illicit drugs . Hypertension can be diagnosed with blood pressure measurements that are consistently above normal range . Hypertension can be treated with lifestyle modifications and/or medications that lower blood pressure."
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a break in the inner lining of the stomach , the first part of the small intestine , or sometimes the lower esophagus . An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer , while one in the first part of the small intestine is a duodenal ulcer. An ulcer in the esophagus is called an esophageal ulcer. Peptic ulcers are usually caused by infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) or by long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Peptic ulcers can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, burning sensation, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss, and bleeding. Peptic ulcers can be diagnosed with tests that detect H. pylori infection or with endoscopy that visualizes the ulcers. Peptic ulcers can be treated with medications that suppress acid production, eradicate H. pylori infection, or protect the lining of the stomach and intestine."
Dimorphic hemorrhoids(piles),"Hemorrhoids, also spelled haemorrhoids, are vascular structures in the anal canal. In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control. They become pathological or piles when swollen or inflamed. Hemorrhoids can be classified as internal or external depending on their location. Internal hemorrhoids are located above the dentate line and are usually painless but may bleed or prolapse. External hemorrhoids are located below the dentate line and are often painful and prone to thrombosis. Hemorrhoids are caused by increased pressure in the lower rectum due to straining during bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, pregnancy, obesity, or aging. Hemorrhoids can be diagnosed with physical examination or anoscopy that examines the anal canal. Hemorrhoids can be treated with conservative measures such as dietary fiber, fluids, sitz baths, topical creams, or suppositories. In some cases , surgical procedures such as rubber band ligation , sclerotherapy , infrared coagulation , or hemorrhoidectomy may be required ."
Common Cold,"The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold. The most common ones are rhinoviruses , which are responsible for about 30% to 50% of colds . Other viruses that can cause colds include coronaviruses , adenoviruses , respiratory syncytial virus , and parainfluenza virus . The common cold is spread by respiratory droplets from coughing , sneezing , or talking , or by direct contact with infected surfaces . The common cold can cause symptoms such as sore throat , runny nose , nasal congestion , sneezing , cough , headache , low-grade fever , and malaise . The common cold usually lasts for about 7 to 10 days . There is no specific treatment for the common cold . The best way to prevent it is to wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with sick people . You can also boost your immune system by getting enough sleep , drinking plenty of fluids , and eating a balanced diet ."
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It can cause an itchy, blister-like rash. The rash first appears on the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body, causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters."
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs)."

Fungal infection,"In humans, fungal infections occur when an invading fungus takes over an area of the body and is too much for the immune system to handle. Fungi can live in the air, soil, water, and plants. There are also some fungi that live naturally in the human body. Like many microbes, there are helpful fungi and harmful fungi."
Hepatitis C,"Inflammation of the liver due to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is usually spread via blood transfusion (rare), hemodialysis, and needle sticks. The damage hepatitis C does to the liver can lead to cirrhosis and its complications as well as cancer."
Migraine,"A migraine can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities."
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial asthma is a medical condition which causes the airway path of the lungs to swell and narrow. Due to this swelling, the air path produces excess mucus making it hard to breathe, which results in coughing, short breath, and wheezing. The disease is chronic and interferes with daily working."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is a diseased, inflammatory condition of the liver caused by heavy alcohol consumption over an extended period of time. It's also aggravated by binge drinking and ongoing alcohol use. If you develop this condition, you must stop drinking alcohol"

Heart attack,"The death of heart muscle due to the loss of blood supply. The loss of blood supply is usually caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery, one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it. The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe."
Arthritis, "A condition that causes inflammation or swelling of one or more joints. It can affect any joint in the body but commonly affects the hands knees hips and spine. There are many types of arthritis each with different causes and treatments. Some of the most common types are osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis gout and psoriatic arthritis.
